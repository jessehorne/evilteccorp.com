    <h1>API Documentation</h1>

    <div>
        Welcome, new employee. By registering an account you have proven that you have what it takes to last here at Evil Tec Corp. as a software engineer.
    </div>

    <div>
        By participating in our Employment Challenge System you agree to never talk about this to anyone and plead the fifth when those pesky state officials come knocking on your door, which they might!
    </div>

    <div>
        You will only receive wages upon completing a project. The amount you will earn depends on the project and will be specified when details are shared. Each employee will be paid in Evil-Coins, an online-only currency that we control in a centralized database. Our Evil-Coin to USD converter is down, due to the strikes.
    </div>
